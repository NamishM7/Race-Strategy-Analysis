# Formula 1 Race Strategy Analysis and Visualisations

This GitHub repository contains a collection of tools and scripts for analysing and visualising Formula 1 race strategy and laptime data. The project aims to provide insights into race strategies employed by Formula 1 teams and aid in understanding laptime patterns throughout the race.

## Features

- Import and process FIA official race data, including full race laptime information for drivers and teams of interest.
- Analyse laptime trends and key performance metrics.
- Generate visualisations such as line plots, scatter plots, stacked area plots, and histograms to analyse race strategy and laptime data.
- Compare and contrast different drivers' laptime performances to identify patterns and anomalies.
- Calculate and visualize cumulative lap times for individual drivers across the race.
- Perform statistical analysis and derive valuable insights for race strategy optimisation.

## Blogs & Reports

- Concise summaries of core strategic decisions that effect race results.
- Hypotheses as to potential external factors or alternative decisions could have impacted the race significantly.

## Introduction to Race Strategy

- **Tyre Management:** Managing tyre degradation and choosing the right tyre compounds for different stages of the race is essential. Teams need to determine the optimal time for pit stops to minimise time loss and maintain competitive lap times.

- **Fuel Strategy:** Strategically managing fuel consumption throughout the race is vital. Calculating the optimal fuel load, considering factors such as race distance, car performance, and anticipated safety car periods, helps teams maximise speed while minimizing weight.

- **Overtaking Opportunities:** Identifying and capitalising on overtaking opportunities is crucial for gaining track position. Teams analyse circuit layouts and their features, such as DRS zones, to devise strategic plans for overtaking competitors effectively. On circuits like Monaco, track position is key since overtaking on track is extremely difficult!

- **Pit Stop Strategy:** Carefully planning pit stops and their timing can significantly impact race outcomes. Factors such as traffic, tyre wear, and track position are considered to determine when to pit for fresh tyres, balancing the advantage of improved performance against the potential loss of track position.

- **Safety Car and Virtual Safety Car (VSC):** Reacting to safety car periods or VSC situations can present strategic opportunities. Teams evaluate whether to pit for fresh tyres, take advantage of the neutralized field, or stay out to gain track position.

- **Weather Conditions:** Monitoring and adapting to changing weather conditions is essential. Rain or temperature variations can significantly impact tyre performance and overall race strategy. Teams assess forecasts and adjust their plans accordingly.

- **Race Simulation and Analysis:** Utilizing race simulations and data analysis tools, teams evaluate different strategic options and scenarios before the race. This helps them identify optimal strategies based on various factors like pace, track position, and competitor behavior.

- **Driver Management:** Teams consider driver capabilities, strengths, and weaknesses when devising race strategies. Tailoring the strategy to each driver's style and preferences can yield better performance and increase the chances of success.

- **Competitor Analysis:** Analysing competitor behaviors, strengths, and weaknesses provides insights into their likely strategies. This information helps teams anticipate their rivals' moves and formulate effective counter-strategies.
