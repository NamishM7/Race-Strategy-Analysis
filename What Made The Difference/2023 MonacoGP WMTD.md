# *What Made the Difference?* MonacoGP: Verstappen vs Alonso and The Fight for Third

## Qualifying

The Monaco Grand Prix circuit, infamous for its slow hairpins and tight chicanes, features little opportunity for overtakes, especially in the modern Formula 1 vehicles which have grown in size year on year. As a result, the qualifying session in Monaco is considered to be the most important of the season; a poor performance on Saturday in Monaco almost impossible to recover on the Sunday, while a strong showing on Saturday can be easier to convert and maintain in the race.

With the Monaco circuit characteristics seemingly levelling the balance of performance among the top teams, the RB19 unable to capitalise on its straight-line speed and DRS efficiciency advantage, the fight for pole position was open to at least 3 teams. With Alonso's strong performances all season, and continuing the run of form in the early stages of qualifying, he looked to be the primary source of competition for Verstappen.

Nothing is a given in Monaco, and the rather extreme track evolution (increasing speed of the circuit) led to challenging strategic battles throughout qualifying. In these conditions, with an ever-evolving track surface and laptimes continuing to improve, ensuring that the tyres are in the right temperature conditions in combination with securing suitable track position for the final hotlap of the session, is vital for delivering an optimal lap. As the final part of qualifying drew to a close, it was Ocon, Alonso, and Verstappen who would be most successful in this strategy. So, what made the difference?

Sector 1 showed the smallest inter-quartile field spread, perhaps to be expected given the nature of this sector, featuring significant full-throttle running and being the shortest of the three. In this sector, it was Alonso who consistently set the fastest times, with an optimal 18.496 seconds, his personal best.

Sector 2 showed the largest inter-quartile field spread, and given this sector is almost twice as long as sector 1, with some of the slowest corners on the entire Formula 1 calendar, before leading onto the famous high-speed curve through the tunnel, lending itself to significant time gain or loss, it is expected to be the sector with the highest laptime variation. Once again, it was Alonso who was fastest in Sector 2 in his final run of Q3, posting a time of 33.844 seconds.

Finally, in sector 3, it was Max Verstappen who turned the tide on Alonso and posted an 18.821 second time, a tenth of a second faster than Ocon, the next best. As it transpired, it would be this sector 3 time from Verstappen that would secure pole position ahead of Alonso in P2. Given the duration of sector 3 being similar to that of the first sector, it may be surprising to see a significantly larger inter-quartile field spread, however the nature of the track elements in this third sector compared to the first, invites greater uncertainty and variety in the drivers' execution, with the tricky swimming pool chicane and challenging low-speed penultimate corner.

The cumulative laptime delta to Verstappen, for Alonso, Leclerc, and Ocon is shown below. At the sector 1 timing line Alonso is trending for pole position with a ~0.15 second advantage over Verstappen, a margin that is improved to ~0.2 seconds at the sector 2 timing line. Leclerc was also able to improve relative to Verstappen in sector 2, after being slightly behind in the first. Verstappen however, submitted an impressive sector 3 time to reclaim any time loss from the earlier stages of the lap, as can be seen by the steep incline in relative time delta for Alonso, Leclerc and Ocon at the final timing line. The relative gradients of the final trend show that Alonso lost out the most in sector 3 relative to Verstappen, with Ocon the closest to Max's time, resulting in the most shallow delta gradient of the 3. The theoretical optimal lap trace is shown as a dotted line, confirming the optimal lap would come in the combination of Alonso's sector 1 and 2 times, concluded by Verstappen's sector 3.
